<h2> Dear Enflick Employers, </h2>

<p> I didn't make a cover letter because I thought this might be better for your time. </p>
<br>
<h3> First: Your Web Developer position </h3> 

<p> I applied to this position because, well, I love web development. You say I require HTML5 and CSS3 experience, and I definitely have that (look at the site!). If you head over to the "what I've made" section, you'll notice that 75% of the projects on there are HTML5 and CSS3. <p>

<p> You also say you require javascript experience. While I am no pro at that, I assure you that I really want to be. I've used jQuery, jQuery mobile, Sencha Touch (unfortunately), and a handful of other libraries. I absolutely love the freedom javascript gives, so much that my friends get quite bothered with me when I tell them they should be learning it over c++ for mobile development. I have also used Ajax/JSON for server calls (postgreSQL servers) and I have used Rails to manipulate and manage servers.  </p>

<p> I HAVE used Java a lot for making android and playbook applications, but I have never used it for desktop applications. I have played around with Python, but not to the extent where I could even call myself competent with it. I have also never attempted to use PHP, though I have been meaning to (using pure Javascript for servers is getting frustrating).</p>

<p> But the most important part that stuck out to me on your job posting was the use of Backbone.js. Its hard finding people that even know what Backbone.js is. Luckily for both you and I, I know what it is! This entire website is built on top of Backbone.js mixed with require.js. Yes, it does follow a boilerplate, but you can check out the insight.md I wrote to help others trying to learn about the boilerplate! I also took the codeschool backbone class. So, I'm definitely not a pro at backbone.js, but I know how it works and would really love to get to know more about it </p>

<h3> Also: Your Mobile Application Developer position and UI Design </h3>

<p> Did you say Android using Java? Because thats one of my specialties. And come October, Blackberries will be able to run Java apps natively (from the Android SDK). I've done that too (for Playbook)! I develop mainly in Eclipse, though I have used Xcode for converting web-apps into iPhone form. I've never done iOS development but I would really love to learn. I tend to do html5/javascript apps and ship them off with Phonegap. </p>

<p> As for UI design: That was part of my job at Communitech! We were building apps from nothing. Basic specifications. I had to decide what buttons belonged where and what colours they should be. I had to decide whether or not certain UI elements would be on the same page or on different tabs. I also had to decide optimal locations for nearly everything. I used Photoshop for the creation of UI elements that weren't just built in (buttons, etc). I use photoshop almost weekly, just playing around making posters and icons and all sorts of stuff. None of my photoshop skills are shown here, but I assure you I definitely know what I'm doing with it.</p> 

<p> So why am I being so honest? Because I don't feel like lying to somebody I want to work for. I'm not amazing at javascript, and I only know how backbone works (but I know how to use it somewhat!). I don't know how to code for iOS, and I have no idea how PHP works. But I would be lying if I said I wouldn't work my hardest in trying to be the best at it if thats what the job requires. </p>
