<h2> Dear D2L Employers, </h2>

<p> You guys hire like 60 people and have to deal with hundreds of applications each term so I didn't write a cover letter that you would feel obligated to read. Instead I just made this one on my resume website, because if you travelled this far, it means you must be interested. This is more of an informal "why I want the job" than it is a cover letter.  </p>

<h3> First: Your Web Developer position </h3> 

<p> Web development is one of my favourite things! HTML/CSS/Javascript together is just extremely fun. I really enjoy how dynamic it all is and I love just trying to create brand new things with it. That being said, Javascript is really interesting me and I've used quite a few libraries (as seen in my "what I know" page), and I've been wanting to expand my knowledge on it ever since my job at Communitech (right under you guys!). </p>

<p> So yes, I do know HTML pretty well. I also know CSS3 (because, you know, you kind of need to know it for HTML). I am also really familiar with Javascript, and a bunch of libraries (backbone, require, jQuery/mobile, zepto, etc..). I have used SQL (postgreSQL and Ruby on Rails) though I am a bit unknowledgable in the database creation aspect of that. I have managed incoming requests and used proper JSON calls to servers though. </p>

<p>I have, on the other hand, not had a chance to try using .NET
