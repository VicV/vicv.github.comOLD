<h3>AMD and Require.js</h3>
<p>Asynchronous Module Definitions designed to load modular code asynchronously in the browser and server. It is actually a fork of the Common.js specification. Many script loaders have built their implementations around AMD, seeing it as the future of modular Javascript development.</p>

<p>Backboneboilerplate.com supports Require.js the default AMD loader.   It has a vibrant open-source ecology.</p>
